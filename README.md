How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

User stories help paint a clear picture of what a user whats a program to do. User stories remove having a developer guess what the user wants to happen. 

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When starting a new program, a developer needs to know what to include and what to avoid. The client needs to make their needs clear to avoid any future headaches. Once all the required information has been received, then the developer or devlopment team can decide what development model is best for this project. Agile development has many processes that aid in developing software, like scrum, feature driven development and extreme programming. Agile revolves around frequent testing and inspection, and I will absolultely incorportate this into my future work.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

When working within a  software development team, its important to listen to others and be accountable for your own work.
